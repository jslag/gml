I recently was invited to use Google's GMail service by a friend.  As you 
certainly know, Google included an entire gigabyte of storage space with 
the account, which is wonderful for email packrats like me.  I, for instance, 
have all my email dating back from 1994 stored in Netscape.  When I realized 
the benefit of having all my email easily searched and managed through GMail, 
I looked for an option to import my existing messages.  No such feature exists.

To remedy this problem, I've created the Mbox & Maildir to Gmail Loader (GML).  

To use, simply download the executable to the same folder as your mbox files.  
Then, run the command:

  gml.exe [mbox or maildir] [mbox file or maildir path] [gmail address]

For example, when I transferred my Netscape email to my new GMail account, I 
used the command:

  gml.exe mbox "c:\mail\Inbox" marklyon@gmail.com

The loader will then send one message every 2 seconds to GMail's servers.  
The delay between messages is to reduce the load sending so many messages 
will certainly create.  Start it running, go to bed, and see the results in 
the morning.  Alternatively, you can sort your messages as they come in. 

The messages will not be deleted from your local Mbox file, so you can 
continue to use that as a permanent storage location.  Personally, I have set 
up my mail to be stored on a POP3 server which is downloaded into Mozilla for 
long-term storage and forwarded to GMail for web-based usage.
